### Objective

Congo Online Retail Inc. needs to run daily inventory checks (7 days a week) with a Schedule named **CONGO INVENTORY MANAGEMENT**. 

A specific program must be run for each product department and each product Job should be Tagged by department.  
  
*	**Toys** – ```"C:\scripts\CheckInvToys.EXE"```
  *	Legos
  *	Nerf
*	**Electronics** – ```"C:\scripts\CheckInvElectronics.EXE"```
  *	Smartphones
  *	Xbox
*	**Clothing** – ```"C:\scripts\CheckInvClothing.EXE"```
  *	Levis
  *	Nike

Each product is assigned a **Product ID Number**. This ID Number will be used by the program as an argument for the ```-t``` time interval for each job:

  * Legos - ```11```
  * Nerf - ```12```
  * Smartphones - ```21```
  * Xbox - ```22```
  * Levis - ```31```
  * Nike - ```32```
  * Inventory Report - ```100```

The Jobs must run every ```30 minutes``` until ```11:45 PM```.
  
The programs read the database and generate order requests to purchase new items. At the end of the day, an **Inventory Purchase Report** is created with the results. This must be created as a ```UNIX``` Job with the following **Start Image**:

```/usr/local/labfiles/CheckInvPurRpt –t100```

## Annual Plan Calendar - Event Updates


* Two Steps in Using Annual Plan Calendar:
    * Create/Maintain a Calendar
    * Apply the Calendar to frequency
* **A/O/B/N** is not configurable 
* Offsets use workdays

## Calendar Events

* Dates can be added or removed from a Calendar through Events

```
$CALENDAR:ADD,Company Holiday Calendar,05/25/2025; 05/25/2026; 05/25/2027; 05/25/2028; 05/25/2029,ocadm,opconxps
```

```
$CALENDAR:DEL,Company Holiday Calendar,05/25/2025; 05/25/2026; 05/25/2027; 05/25/2028; 05/25/2029,ocadm,opconxps
```

* Scenarios:
    * A Job needs to run 10 working days after the 15th of month 
    * A Null Job scheduled to run on the 15th could submit:
```
$CALENDAR:ADD,Company Holiday Calendar,[[$SCHEDULE DATE(+10wd)]],ocadm,opconxps
```
* A Job needs to run the working day before a different Job scheduled for the 15th-B

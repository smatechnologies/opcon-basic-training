### Exercise 9: Frequencies - On Request & Beginning, Middle, End of Period

##### Objective: 

Within the existing **Frequency Practice Schedule**, create four new Null Jobs:


**On Request Frequency Practice**
**Begin of Period Frequency Practice**
**Mid of Period Frequency Practice**
**End of Period Frequency Practice**

In the **On Request Frequency Practice** Job, create a new Frequency named ```OnRequest```. This Frequency should run **On Request** on the date requested. In this case, set the date as January 3rd.

In the **Begin of Period Frequency Practice** Job, create a new Frequency named ```BOM-A```. This Frequency should run on the 1st Working Day of each month, or the day after in case of a holiday.

In the **Mid of Period Frequency Practice** Job, create a new Frequency named ```Mid-Wed-A```. This Frequency should run on the Wednesday closest to the middle of the month, or the day after in case of a holiday.

In the **End of Period Frequency Practice** Job, create a new Frequency named ```EOM-B```. This Frequency should run on the last Working Day of the month, or the day before in case of a holiday.

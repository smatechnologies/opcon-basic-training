### Exercise 3: Steps to Define a Job 

##### Objective: 

Create a Job named **WINDOWS JOB 1** within the schedule named **MY FIRST SCHEDULE**. The Job must run on the ```WINDOWS``` machine type. The Job must use the ```SMATRAINING``` machine and the ```SMATRAINING\SMAUSER``` User Id. The command line should run the following program:

```"C:\Program Files\OpConxps\MSLSAM\genericp.exe" -t10```

Assign the Job an **Existing Frequency** of ```Example-Mon-Sun-O```. Repeat the preceding steps to create 3 more Jobs identical to **WINDOWS JOB 1** following the same naming pattern.

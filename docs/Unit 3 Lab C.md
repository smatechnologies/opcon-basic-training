## LAB C

### Objective

Through a Schedule named **CONGO ACCOUNTING FOLDERS**, your Accounting Team needs a daily (Monday-Friday) folder created in the ```C:\Accounting``` folder for each of the following products:

* Legos
* Nerf
* Smartphones
* Xbox
* Levis
* Nike

The following script should be used to create each folder:

```
“C:\scripts\Create_Folder.cmd” “C:\Accounting\yyyy-mm-dd-Legos”
```
where "Legos" is the product.

Create three Global Properties that will be used in place of the following objects on the command line:

*	```C:\scripts```
*	```C:\Accounting```
*	```yyyy-mm-dd```

    *	This will require a System Global Property ```[[$SCHEDULE DATE]]``` in the correct format

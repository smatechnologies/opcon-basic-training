* Failure Criteria - Advanced tab allows the specification of multiple Exit Codes
* Combining this with Events based on Job Exit Description allows OpCon to behave differently based on Exit Condition
* **Unlike Events based on Job Exit Description**, Advanced Failure Criteria does **NOT** need the full Exit Code

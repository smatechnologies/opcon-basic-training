### Querying with Wildcards

* For advanced querying, the Filter bar accepts the wildcard characters of asterisk (```*```) and question mark (```?```)
  * The asterisk wildcard can be used to match zero to many characters
  * The question mark wildcard must match a single (```one```) character
  * By default, the Filter will perform a ```CONTAINS``` operation against the dataset with the given text query
  * If the Filter query begins with an equal sign (```=```), the query becomes strict instead of performing a ```CONTAINS``` operation

### User Accounts

* Once authenticated, User Account inherits Privileges through **Roles**

* Required fields:
  * User Login ID (Name)
  * Full User Name
  * At least one assigned Role
* E-mail Address
  * This is required for Email Escalation (to be covered later in this Unit)
  * If the field is not editable, the SMTP connection information is not configured within OpCon

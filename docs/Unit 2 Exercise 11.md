## Exercise 11: Multiple Frequencies

### Objective 

Create a new Schedule named **MULTIPLE AND NEGATIVE FREQUENCIES** that runs Monday-Friday. Add a Null Job named **MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES**. 

Create a Frequency to run on the **15th of the Month** and a second Frequency to run on the **last business day of the month**. 

The Job should run at ```20:00``` on when it is not the last day of the month and ```18:00``` on the last day of the month.

Within the same Schedule, create a new Job named **NEGATIVE FREQUENCIES**. The Job should have Frequencies that allow it to run Monday-Friday, unless it is a **holiday** or the **last Day of the month**.

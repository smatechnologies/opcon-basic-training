* The Repository allows for Version Control

#### Four part make up Embedded Scripts

* Script Types
* Script Runners
* Script Repository
* Job Master

### Script Types

![](../static/imgbasic/sm-script-types.png)

* Configure type of Scripts which can be stored by OpCon
* There are 6 **predefined** Script types, but more can be added
  * Command Shell (.cmd)
  * Perl (.ps)
  * PowerShell (.ps1)
  * Python (.py)
  * VBScript (.vbs)
  * SQL (.sql)

### Script Runners

![](../static/imgbasic/sm-script-runners.png)

* Script Runners define Command Line created to run Script
* Allows more than one Script runner per Script Type

:::tip Example

Powershell would include ```"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass and -File"``` before command, so the **Script Runner** would look like: ```powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $FILE $ARGUMENTS```.

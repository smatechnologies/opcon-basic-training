sidebar_label: 'Creating Categories'

Service Requests can be grouped into defined Categories

* A specific Department or User Group can be defined as a Category, for example

To Create and associate a Category:

* Click the small  ```Create``` text in the Top Left-Hand Corner of the Self-Service Main Page

* The New Category page will display with the following options:
    * Name
        * Best Practice is to choose a naming convention that will help to refine the Service Request Filtering Query
    * For example, naming a Category "Important/Saturday" would allow "Saturday" to be used as the Category Filter
    * Color
    * Service Requests
        * Select the Service Requests desired to be assigned to the New Category

* Once the Category is created, previously unassigned Service Requests can now be assigned to a preferred Category

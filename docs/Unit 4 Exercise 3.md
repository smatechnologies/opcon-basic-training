## Exercise 3: Thresholds - External Events

### Objective 

To use an Event to increment and decrement the value of a Threshold.

### Summary

Utilizing the **My Threshold Schedule** created in the previous exercise, you will create a new job that will execute a script called **ExerciseThreshold.cmd** and pass a variable of **+1**. You will manually add this job to the Operations View and run it. Then you will modify and rerun the job with a new value of **-1**.

### Instructions

#### Create the Job

1.	In **Library** > **Administration**, select **Master Job**.
2.  Click **Add**
3.	In the **Master Job Definition** screen:
* In the **Schedule** drop down, select **My Threshold Schedule**.
* In the **Name** field, enter ```Threshold External Event Job```.
* In the **Job Type** drop down, select **Windows**.
* In the **Machine** drop down, select **SMATraining**.
* In the **User ID** drop down, select **SMATRAINING\SMAUSER**.
* In the **Command Line** field, enter ```"C:\scripts\ExerciseThreshold.cmd" +1```. _Remember to use properties where acceptable._
* Do not forget to add **Documentation**.
* In the **frequency** section, move the ```Mon-Sun-O``` frequency into the **Active** column.
  
#### Validate the Current Value of the Threshold

4.	In **Library** > **Administration**, select **Thresholds**.
5.	Select **TrainingThreshold**.
6.	Check the value. At this moment, it should be ```0```.
7.  Exit **Thresholds** without making any changes.

#### Add the Job to Operations

8.	Open **Processes** to verify that **My Threshold Schedule** is completed.
9. Right-click to **My Threshold Schedule** and add the Job just created to the Daily Schedule list.
* Select **My Threshold Schedule** and click the **(+)** button in the **Schedule Selection** side menu.
* Select **Threshold External Event Job** and click the **Next** button.
* Change the Build Status to **Released**.
* Click the **Next** button.
* Click the **Submit** button.
* Close the **Add Jobs** results screen.
* Wait until the Job finishes **OK**.
10.	In **Library** > **Administration**, select **Thresholds**.
11.	Select **TrainingThreshold** from the **Select Threshold** drop-down list.
12.	Check the value. At this moment, it should be ```1```. 

:::note
What happened?
* The Job ran and created a file under the ```MSGIN``` folder. 
* The file sent the ```$THRESHOLD:SET,TrainingThreshold,+1``` event using the ```ocadm``` OpCon account and its event token (```opconxps```).
  * OpCon received the Event and processed it. It updated the value of the Threshold: ```0 + 1 = 1```

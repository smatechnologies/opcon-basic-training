### Heartbeat Indicator

The **Heartbeat indicator** quickly identifies the status of the SAMÂ and/or the Agents. Depending on the current state of the SAM and Agents, this indicator will have one of the following visual aspects:

- ![Heartbeat Indicator 1](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator1.png "Heartbeat Indicator 1") - This indicates that the communication between Solution Manager and OpCon Rest API is broken.
- ![Heartbeat Indicator 2](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator2.png "Heartbeat Indicator 2") - This indicates that the SAM is DOWN.
- ![Heartbeat Indicator 7](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator7.png "Heartbeat Indicator 7")- This indicates that the SAM is DOWN and at least one Agent is waiting on communication.
- ![Heartbeat Indicator 3](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator3.png "Heartbeat Indicator 3") - This indicates that the SAM is UP and all started Agents are communicating (whether limited or not).
- ![Heartbeat Indicator 4](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator4.png "Heartbeat Indicator 4") - This indicates that the SAM is UP, but at least one Agent is waiting on communication (and none is in error).
- ![Heartbeat Indicator 5](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator5.png "Heartbeat Indicator 5") - This indicates that the SAM is UP, but at least one started Agent does not respond (and at least one is started or waiting).
- ![Heartbeat Indicator 6](../static/imgbasic/HeartbeatIndicator6.png "Heartbeat Indicator 6") - This indicates that the SAM is UP, but all started Agents do not respond (in error).

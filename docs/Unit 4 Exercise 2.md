Create a **Threshold Update** on the Job for a **Finished OK** status with a value of ```0```.

Create another Windows Job named **Threshold Update Job** that runs the generic program on a ```7 day``` Frequency. 

Create a **Threshold Update** on the Job for a Finished OK status with a value of ```2```.

Create a Null Job named **Threshold Initial Value Job** that runs on a ```7 day``` Frequency. 

Add a ```$NOTIFY:EMAIL``` **Event** to the Job that runs:

```
smauser@congo.local,,,Initial value of TrainingThreshold,Initial value of TrainingThreshold is [[TH.TrainingThreshold]]
```

Add a second Null Job named **Threshold After Update Job** copied from the first Job. Update the Event Parameters to:

```
smauser@congo.local,,,After the update,After the update the value of TrainingThreshold is [[TH.TrainingThreshold]]
```

Create a third Null Job named **Threshold Final Value Job** copied from the last Job. Update the Event Parameters to:

```
smauser@congo.local,,,Final value of TrainingThreshold,Final value of TrainingThreshold is [[TH.TrainingThreshold]]
```

Set Dependencies on the Jobs as such:

**Threshold Initial Value Job > Threshold Update Job > Threshold After Update Job**

**TrainingThreshold > Threshold Dependency Job > Threshold Final Value Job**

Build the Schedule Released for Today. View results in Matrix View or Solution Manager.

Open **Thunderbird** to verify Notifications.

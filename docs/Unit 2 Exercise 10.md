### Exercise 10: Frequencies - On Interval and Annual Plan Calendar

##### Objective:

Within the existing **Frequency Practice Schedule**, create three new Null Jobs:

* **On Interval Frequency Practice**
* **Annual Frequency Practice**
* **Annual Plan Frequency with Offsets**

In the **On Interval Frequency Practice** Job, create a new Frequency named ```Every-15thand30th-B```. This Frequency should run on intervals of the 15th and 30th of the month, or the day before in case of a holiday.

In the **Calendar Master**, add a new Calendar named ```Company Holiday Calendar``` and select several dates from this year. Provide appropriate documentation.

In the **Annual Frequency Practice** Job, create a new Frequency named ```CompanyHoliday```. Schedule the Frequency using an **Annual Plan** by selecting the ```Company Holiday Calendar```.

In the **Annual Plan Frequency with Offsets** Job, create a new Frequency named ```CompanyHoliday+1```. This Frequency should use the ```Company Holiday Calendar``` **Annual Plan** with an offset of ```1 day```.

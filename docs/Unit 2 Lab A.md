    * The Working Day before, if date falls on a Non-Working Day
  *	Last Working Day of the month
    * The Working Day before, if date falls on a Non-Working Day
  *	An End of Year Payroll that includes both the monthly Payroll and Bonuses is run in place of the End of Month Payroll on the last working day of the year  

**Clothing – Levis and Nike**  

  *	Every Friday
    * The Working Day after, if date falls on a Non-Working Day

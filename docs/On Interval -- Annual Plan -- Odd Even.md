## Frequency Definition Wizard - On Interval, Annual Plan, Odd & Even Weeks

### On Intervals

* Essentially the On Day option, but blocked in multiples of 5 (instead of creating 6 different Frequencies)

-OR-

* Every X number of days starting on X date
* Start Date can be the same every year, or could be one time start date and increments keep going forever
* Other Fields:
  * **A/O/B/N** flag is applicable
  * The Calendar selected will block off days listed within a Calendar AFTER **A/O/B/N** days are set
